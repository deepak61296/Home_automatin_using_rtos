# Smart Home Automation System

## Overview

The Smart Home Automation System is an embedded project designed to automate various home functions using an RTOS (FreeRTOS) on an ESP32 or Arduino. It integrates sensors and actuators to monitor temperature and humidity, control lights, detect motion, and display real-time information on an LCD. The system also features a PID control algorithm to regulate a stepper motor based on temperature readings.

## Project Features

- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: Reads data from a DHT22 sensor and manages a stepper motor based on temperature.
- **LED Control**: Adjusts an LED based on light levels detected by an LDR sensor.
- **Motion Detection**: Activates a buzzer when motion is detected by a PIR sensor.
- **LCD Display**: Shows current temperature on an I2C LCD.
- **System Health Monitoring**: Logs system health and status messages.

## Design Choices

### Tasks and Functionalities

1. **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: Monitors environmental conditions and uses PID control to adjust the stepper motor.
2. **LED Control**: Controls an LED based on light intensity to simulate light-based automation.
3. **Motion Detection and Buzzer Control**: Provides a security feature for detecting intrusions.
4. **LCD Display**: Provides real-time temperature feedback to the user.
5. **System Health Monitoring**: Ensures all tasks are running correctly and the system is functioning as expected.

### Task Priorities

- **Task 1 (Temperature and Humidity Monitoring)**: Priority 1
- **Task 2 (LED Control)**: Priority 1
- **Task 3 (Motion Detection and Buzzer Control)**: Priority 1
- **Task 4 (LCD Display)**: Priority 1
- **Task 6 (System Health Monitoring)**: Priority 1

### RTOS Features

- **Semaphores/Mutexes**: Used to protect shared resources such as sensor data, LCD updates, and motor control.
- **Task Notifications**: Managed through `vTaskDelay()` for periodic task execution.

### PID Control Implementation

- **Proportional (Kp)**: Adjusts motor speed based on temperature error.
- **Integral (Ki)**: Compensates for accumulated errors over time.
- **Derivative (Kd)**: Predicts future errors based on the rate of change.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ESP32 or Arduino board
- Required Libraries: `DHT`, `LiquidCrystal_I2C`
- [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) for virtual testing

### Setup

1. **Create a Wokwi Project**:
   - Go to [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/).
   - Create a new project and select the appropriate board.

2. **Upload Code**:
   - Create the necessary files:
     - `main.cpp`
     - `TaskTemperatureHumidity.cpp`
     - `TaskLDR.cpp`
     - `TaskPIR.cpp`
     - `TaskLCD.cpp`
     - `TaskSystemHealth.cpp`
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the respective files.

3. **Add Libraries**:
   - Ensure that the required libraries are added to your Wokwi project.

4. **Compile and Upload**:
   - Compile the code and upload it to the virtual board.

### Testing

1. **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**:
   - Verify that temperature and humidity readings are displayed on the Serial Monitor.

2. **LED Control**:
   - Test the LED control by varying light conditions and ensuring the LED responds appropriately.

3. **Motion Detection**:
   - Simulate motion and confirm that the buzzer activates as expected.

4. **LCD Display**:
   - Check that the LCD displays the current temperature and updates periodically.

5. **System Health**:
   - Monitor the Serial Monitor for health messages to ensure all tasks are operational.
