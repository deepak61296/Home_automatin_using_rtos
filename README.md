# Smart Home Automation System

## Overview

The Smart Home Automation System integrates sensors and actuators to automate home functions using an RTOS (FreeRTOS) on an ESP32 or Arduino. This project features temperature and humidity monitoring, LED control, motion detection, and real-time information display on an LCD. It also includes PID control to regulate a stepper motor based on temperature readings.

## Design Choices

### Tasks and Priorities

1. **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: Reads data from a DHT22 sensor and manages the stepper motor based on temperature. (Priority 1)
2. **LED Control**: Adjusts an LED based on light levels detected by an LDR sensor. (Priority 1)
3. **Motion Detection and Buzzer Control**: Activates a buzzer when motion is detected by a PIR sensor. (Priority 1)
4. **LCD Display**: Shows the current temperature on an I2C LCD. (Priority 1)
5. **System Health Monitoring**: Logs system health and status messages. (Priority 1)

### RTOS Features

- **Semaphores/Mutexes**: Used to protect shared resources such as sensor data, LCD updates, and motor control. This ensures that tasks do not interfere with each other when accessing shared resources.
- **Task Notifications**: Managed through `vTaskDelay()` to schedule periodic task execution.

### PID Control

- **Proportional (Kp)**: Adjusts motor speed based on the difference between the desired and actual temperatures.
- **Integral (Ki)**: Compensates for accumulated temperature errors over time.
- **Derivative (Kd)**: Predicts future temperature errors based on the rate of change.

## Instructions for Running and Testing

### Setup in Wokwi

1. **Create a Wokwi Project**:
   - Visit [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) and start a new project with your selected board (ESP32 or Arduino).

2. **Upload Code**:
   - Create the following files in your Wokwi project:
     - `main.cpp`
     - `TaskTemperatureHumidity.cpp`
     - `TaskLDR.cpp`
     - `TaskPIR.cpp`
     - `TaskLCD.cpp`
     - `TaskSystemHealth.cpp`
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the respective files.

3. **Add Libraries**:
   - Ensure that the necessary libraries (`DHT`, `LiquidCrystal_I2C`) are included in your Wokwi project.

4. **Compile and Upload**:
   - Compile the code and upload it to the virtual board.

### Testing

1. **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**:
   - Check the Serial Monitor to verify temperature and humidity readings.

2. **LED Control**:
   - Vary light conditions to ensure the LED responds correctly.

3. **Motion Detection**:
   - Simulate motion and verify that the buzzer activates.

4. **LCD Display**:
   - Confirm that the LCD displays the current temperature and updates as expected.

5. **System Health**:
   - Monitor the Serial Monitor for health messages to ensure all tasks are functioning correctly.
